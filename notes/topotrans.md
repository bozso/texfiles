#### InSAR - Eszter Szűcs

- gas storage monitoring w/ InSAR?, sandstone

#### Progress Report - Sándor Szakács

- use internal resources, not successful projects
- **scatterers**: Ciomadul and Praid salt diapir
    - Coimadul
        - find secure places for reflectors, 3 found, 1 not so secure; private prop. and natural prot. area
        - other optional places
    - Praid
        - 2 secure places, private prop.
- seismic arrays (INFP)
- **sampling**: South Harghita shoshinites
    - post emplacement minerals
    - 1.6 Ma old, prob. younger?
    - cavities, enclaves
- **What's next:**
    - Ciomadul, Praid - scatterers, monitoring motion, long term: multiple stations to cover area adjacent to Ciomadul
    - deploying scatterers in the Vrancea zone
    - mobile seismic arrays in Transylvania
    - prepare future deployment of Hungarian Seismic Array
    - field reconnaissance - deployment locations

#### Samples - Csaba Szabó

- Bixad and Malnas quarry samples
- carbonate vein in shoshonite
- dark patches, 10 microns; gas?, fluid?
- fluid inclusions?

#### Gravity and Magnetic data - Seghedi

- Calimani-Gurghiu-Harghita (CGH) volcanic chain, mainly composite volcanoes
- partially overlap, dominantly andesitic composition
- ages: 10.5 Ma - 0.03 Ma
- southward propagating fault system
- strike-slip and normal faulting
- volcanic centers situated along individual and/or intersections of faults
- maps of residual anomalies
    - strong negative Bouger-anomaly at eastern part, mass deficit in the Carpathian foreland + plate margin geometry
    - highest pos. anomaly - Ditrau syenite intrusion
    - grav. and mag. anomalies &rightarrow; separation of the volcanic chain
- boundary -- 6.5-5.5 Ma, difference in tectonic nature
- not final conclusion!
- not a back arc, oblique collision 

#### Water in magmatism - István Kovács

- "water" makes volcanic eruptions more explosive, lowers density, etc.
- difficult to measure water content, new methodology to constrain water content
- water content in equilibrium
- "water" = structural hydroxyl 
- aim: constrain water content of magmas
- **water plays a role in tectonism**, temporal and spatial variation of water content
- alkaline-basaltic volcanoes - they are in wrong place at the wrong time
- source region: **300 to 1000 ppm, very high**; 2x, 4x the global average
- Message:
    - upper mantle must have been in partially molten state, melt < 1 volume %
    - seismic anisotropy &leftrightarrow; volcanic lines
    - asthenospheric updoming, vertical foliation - pathway to surface
    - how did the melt penetrate the lithosphere?
    - lithospheric folding: anticlines and sinclines - ruptures - pathway to surface

#### Some geological and geophysical elements - Ioan Munteanu

- different strength, elastic properties inside and outside of the Carpathians

#### Crustal structure of the Carpathian orogen - Laura Petrescu

- receiver functions: impulse response of the crust &rightarrow; v<sub>p</sub> / v<sub>s</sub> and depth of Moho, good for looking at sharp velocity changes, bad for: knowing about absolute velocities
- v<sub>p</sub> / v<sub>s</sub> analogous to Poisson ratio &rightarrow; bulk crustal composition
- rec. fun. joint inversion w/ surface waves (good for: absolute vel., bad for: sharp vel. changes)
- gradual Moho, theories:
    - basaltic underplating
    - partial eclogitization of lower crust (fluid deficient regime) - can be ruled out

#### Plume, modeling - Sierd Cloething

- GPS vertical vel., Iberian-peninsula, intramountain basins an enigma &leftarrow; lithosphere folding
- vertical vel. vs. topo. profile approx. same wavelength, entire Spain is subsiding
- plumes below Europe, uplift from plume? oceans, yes; continents not so much
- plume induced delineation? what comes first?
- plume under Iceland - fingering, sidelobes
- similarly in the African Rift System
- model: plume + local heterogeneity (parameter: their distance)
