### Samples - Csaba Szabó

- Bixad and Malnas quarry samples
- carbonate vein in shoshonite
- dark patches, 10 microns; gas?, fluid?
- fluid inclusions?

### Gravity and Magnetic data - Seghedi

- Calimani-Gurghiu-Harghita (CGH) volcanic chain, mainly composite volcanoes
- partially overlap, dominantly andesitic composition
- ages: 10.5 Ma - 0.03 Ma
- southward propagating fault system
- strike-slip and normal faulting
- volcanic centers situated along individual and/or intersections of faults
- maps of residual anomalies
    - strong negative Bouger-anomaly at eastern part, mass deficit in the Carpathian foreland + plate margin geometry
    - highest pos. anomaly - Ditrau syenite intrusion
    - grav. and mag. anomalies &rightarrow; separation of the volcanic chain
- boundary -- 6.5-5.5 Ma, difference in tectonic nature
- not final conclusion!
- not a back arc, oblique collision 

### Water in magmatism - István Kovács

- "water" makes volcanic eruptions more explosive, lowers density, etc.
- difficult to measure water content, new methodology to constrain water content
- water content in equilibrium
- "water" = structural hydroxyl 
- aim: constrain water content of magmas
- **water plays a role in tectonism**, temporal and spatial variation of water content
- alkaline-basaltic volcanoes - they are in wrong place at the wrong time
- source region: **300 to 1000 ppm, very high**; 2x, 4x the global average
- Message:
    - upper mantle must have been in partially molten state, melt < 1 volume %
    - seismic anisotropy &leftrightarrow; volcanic lines
    - asthenospheric updoming, vertical foliation - pathway to surface
    - how did the melt penetrate the lithosphere?
    - lithospheric folding: anticlines and sinclines - ruptures - pathway to surface

### Some geological and geophysical elements - Ioan Munteanu

- different strength, elastic properties inside and outside of the Carpathians

### Crustal structure of the Carpathian orogen - Laura Petrescu

- receiver functions: impulse response of the crust &rightarrow; v<sub>p</sub> / v<sub>s</sub> and depth of Moho, good for looking at sharp velocity changes, bad for: knowing about absolute velocities
- v<sub>p</sub> / v<sub>s</sub> analogous to Poisson ratio &rightarrow; bulk crustal composition
- rec. fun. joint inversion w/ surface waves (good for: absolute vel., bad for: sharp vel. changes)
- gradual Moho, theories:
    - basaltic underplating
    - partial eclogitization of lower crust (fluid deficient regime) - can be ruled out

### Plume, modeling - Sierd Cloething

- GPS vertical vel., Iberian-peninsula, intramountain basins an enigma &leftarrow; lithosphere folding
- vertical vel. vs. topo. profile approx. same wavelength, entire Spain is subsiding
- plumes below Europe, uplift from plume? oceans, yes; continents not so much
- plume induced delineation? what comes first?
- plume under Iceland - fingering, sidelobes
- similarly in the African Rift System
- model: plume + local heterogeneity (parameter: their distance)

## Estimation of LAB depth of Carpathian Bend Area - Attila Novák

### Introduction

- one of the most exciting area in Central Europe
- young geological processess: basin formation, subduction roll-back and break-off
volcanism, post volcanic activity

### Research area

- magnetotelluric stations 70-80 kms away from eaxh other
- planned stations near the Persani Mountains
    - conductivity distribution &harr; post-volcaninc activity

### Magnetotelluric measurements

- using natural electromagnetic waves, assumes planar waves
    - depends on solar activity
- registration of magnetic and electric wave components
- ensuring safe measurements without disturbance from e.g. animals
- output data: apparent resistivity as the function of wave frequency
- inversion to retreive resistivity-depth function

### Limitations 

- galvanic distortions - presence of shallow and local bodies &rarr; charge
distributions, induced currents &rarr; alter magnetotelluric results

### LAB depth estimation with 1D inversion

- resistivity and thickness values of the layers

### Geomagnetic induction arrows

- arrows point towards conductive bodies
- geological strike, perpendicular to arrows
- ellipses dimensionality of data &harr; geological setting

### Summary

- large scale estimation of LAB depth with 1-D inversion
- constrain results with geochemistry

### Questions

- are the results compatible with the results of romanian colleagues
- induction arrows coherently point towards east, conducting body
    - Gyuri Falus: (partial) melt?
    - combine data with romanian clleagues
    - Sierd Cloetingh: magnetotelluric data &rarr; correction for thermal models?


##  Horizontal Stress Field in the Earth Crust of Romania Using Multiple Focal Mechanism Solutions- Mircea Radulian (Andrei Bala)

- catalogue of fault plane solutions (1929 - 2012)
- crustal earthquakes (< 50 km) and intermediate-depth earthquakes (> 50 km)
- ternary diagrams - information about the stress regime
- Moesian Platform (MO): homogenous distribution
- North Dobrogea Orogen (NDBG): tendency for normal (N) strike-slip (SS) and reverse (R) faulting 
- Fogaras (FC): low number of events
- DA: N and SS faulting

### Partial conclusions

- MO
    - situation not clear, a puzzle a faults
    - mainly from Vrancea source
-NDBG:some faults there, not really active
- Southern Carpatians: not enough data

### Horizontal Stress Determination

- cluster the events for STRESSINVERSE
- determination of principle stress orientations, relative stress magnitude
- stress regime index
- maximum horizontal stress from World Stress Map (WMS)
- comparison of WMS data with results
- stress regime index for the different zones

### Conclusions

- question for stress regime: important local influence of Vrancea, tectonic blocs
not too active
    - contribution from regional stress on the magnitude of tectonic stresses
    is almost non-existent
    - stress state is close to isotropic
