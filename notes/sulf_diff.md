# Jakub Ciazela: Sulfide differentation at the upper mantle and lower crust

- ocean research, oc. lito. can have very different structure
- cont. lito.: common study with hungarian colleguaes


## Oceanic lithosphere

- homo. layers, only true for fast-spreading ridges
- slow-spreading ridges can be very different - function of magma supply
- more magma supply: more crust, more melt-mantle reactions, very heterogenous
- low magma supply: less crust, more fractional crystallization
- knowledge from oc. core complexes
    - plutonic rocks move to the ocean floor
    - lots of investigated cases: Kane Megamullion, Atlantis Bank


### Sulfide differentation at high magma supply: Atlantis Bank

- fractional crystallization predominant
- Expedition IODP 360: Colombo, Sri Lanka $\rightarrow$ Port Louis, Mauritius
- expedition ship with drilling tower
- elevated oc. topo. - active detachment
- drill directly from gabbro, prev. drill 1.5 km in gabbro, new: 3 km in gabbro

- mineral composition of sulfide grains:
    - 80% (po) pyrrhotit
    - 15% (ccp) chalcopyrite
    - 5% (pn) pentlandite

- small pores on the surface of sulfide
- sulfide are concomitant with oxides, clinopyroxene inclusions
- crystallization process: iron decreases in the melt
- troilite and pentlandite exsolutions in pyrrhotite
- from analysis: pentlandite are quite cobalt rich


#### Magmatic processes

- Cu, S follow the paths of sufides
- sulfides are often associated with oxide and apatite
- sulfide rich interval: 640-770 mbsf, up to 1 cm large sulfides
- igneous layering intervals (110-167 and 577-596 mbsf)
    - sulfide grains in-situ analysis
    - transition zone profile follows well fine grain profile
- Cu deficit

### Sulfide differentation at low magma supply: Kane Megamullion

- samples from dredging, scrapes the surface
- different from global MORB
- fractional crystallization
- four times mpre enriched with Cu than others
