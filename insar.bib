    abstract = {The banks of the River Danube are one of the most susceptible areas to mass wasting in Hungary. In 2007, a large slump began to develop along the Danube at Dunaszekcso{\{}double acute{\}} and jeopardized properties on land and navigation in the river. Several factors such as geological, hydrogeological and morphological conditions, recurrent flooding and erosion by the Danube led to a gradual development of the large rotational slide. Slope failure has been monitored using GPS, precise levelling techniques and tiltmeters since October 2007. The expected location of the maximum lateral displacement and extrusion was indicated by GPS measurements from the middle of November 2007. The main phase of the slope failure evolution, i.e. the rapid movement on 12 February 2008 was indicated by accelerated tilting of the southern moving block prior to slumping. Small rise of the relatively stable part of the slope was measured after the rapid movements, which may be explained either by the elastic rebound along the slip surface, or by the intrusion of some plastic material into the lower section of the slope. Comparison of geodetic datasets and field observations with the timing of rainfall and water level changes of the Danube suggested that hydrological properties (subsurface flow processes, soil physical properties, infiltration, and perched water table) were primarily responsible for initiation of the studied slump. A model of slope failure evolution is proposed here based on the monitoring and field observations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

    abstract="The Carpathian bend is amongst the tectonically most active areas in Europe where intraplate subduction triggers sub-crustal earthquakes releasing significant amount of seismic energy in a well-defined seismic zone. To constrain the deep processes by exploiting their linkage to the surface processes an accurate knowledge of surface deformations is required. Detection of small-magnitude tectonic processes with high reliability is a challenge in which the recent space geodetic techniques may bright a breakthrough. In this study we used the archive ENVISAT data set of the European Space Agency to investigate the feasibility limit of detecting crustal deformations in the region of the south Carpathian bend, where past geodetic observations failed to unravel the tectonic processes with high details. Despite the inherent limitations of radar interferometry our results show that coherent velocity field can be estimated with a magnitude of few mm/year. The vertical displacement field suggests subsidence in the Brasov basin which is in agreement with former studies, however radar interferometry can provide a more detailed picture.",
